/* dump-hp9k.c: Dump for the HP-PA. It needs some work; for instance, it
 * currently assumes that the data space is the last space in the a.out
 * file. If it weren't the last space, the code would have to adjust
 * pointers (such as header.space_location) that point into spaces beyond
 * the data space, as the data space in the new a.out is larger than that
 * in the original a.out.
 *
 * Also, it is unclear how the checksum field in the a.out header has
 * to be computed.
 *
 * An a.out file must not have holes in HP-UX (or exec(2) would complain
 * about an invalid data segment), therefore we cannot lseek over the
 * ununsed parts of the heap.
 *
 * The code to support dump with a dynamically linked a.out is a hack.
 * I have no idea why it works and if it will continue to work in
 * newer OS releases.
